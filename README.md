Some simple neural net coding exercises

The simplenet.py script trains a small neural net to classify true false statements

The pong_NEAT.py script uses the python-neat and pygame libraries to create a single player game of pong. The NEAT algorithm trains a four neuron single layer neural net by genetic evolution to be able to continuously bounce the ball off of the paddle. The config.ini file contains all of the necessary configuration variables to use the python-neat library.
